# assignment
Hi,
Please check the below bullet points for the my assignment:

- How long you spent on the project
It's about half day. I spend about 1 hour to understand the task, try the game and quick review the source code. Then, I spend about 1 - 2 hour to check obstacle types, tRex, speed, horizon... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3mhYjrpV04&t=314s this youtube video helped a lot. 

- Your Dino's high score
It' more than 2000, but seems like it goes higher if keep the program on for longer time. 

- Explanation of any struggles of the assignment (if any)
For me, it's to find the correct APIs in a big source code file. From the hint, I know Obstable and tRex are the direction to look at firstly, and then check types that the obstable has and what action that each type requires and find the fileds (yPos, minGap, minSpeed)that affect the action. Write basic code and test if the logic make sense eventually. 

- Any other documentation that you think would be helpful/useful
Maybe tell the candidate the OBSTACLES tyeps are defined from line 6174.

Best,
